# Environment Variables for Vercel Deployment

# After deploying backend to Railway, add these environment variables to Vercel:

# Railway Backend URL (get from Railway dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app

# Commands to add to Vercel:
# vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL production
# vercel env add RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL production
# vercel --prod

# This enables your Vercel frontend to communicate with Railway backend
